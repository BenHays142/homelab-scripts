# Homelab Automation

This is a repo containing some of the PowerShell/Bash scripts and Ansible playbooks I've written and utilized within my personal network/homelab. Most of the scripts/playbooks should be self-explanatory by the name alone, but there's (hopefully) descriptions and comments in each file to explain the purpose and actions taken by each script.
